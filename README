Course Project 1: 

The data used in this project is a subset contained in the 
household__power_consumption.txt file.  Only data from 2/1/2007 and 2/2/2007 is 
used in these scripts.   

plot1.R - Typing make_plot1() at the console, the code will generate a histogram 
          plot of the global active power from the 
          household_power_consumption.txt file.
plot2.R - Typing make_plot2() at the console will generate a time series plot of 
          the global active power.
plot3.R - Typing make_plot3() at the console will generate a time series plot of 
          the three sub metering variables.
plot4.R - Typing make_plot4() at the console will generate a 2X2 panel of four 
          plots filling in by columns left to right: (1) a time series of globabl 
          active power (2) time series of the three sub metering variables (3) 
          time series of the voltage variable (4) time series of the global 
          reactive power.
